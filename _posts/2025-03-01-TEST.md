Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, necessitating accurate risk stratification for effective management. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines provide an established framework for diagnosing and treating PE, including the use of the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and the risk stratification to predict 30-day mortality risk. In this study, we analyzed 368 patients with a primary diagnosis of PE from the MIMIC-III database. Using logistic regression models, we assessed the impact of demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities on 30-day mortality.
Findings indicate that cancer, hemodynamic instability, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure significantly impact 30-day mortality rates. Patients classified as PESI Class IV or V had a markedly higher mortality risk compared to those in lower classes. Additionally, high-risk stratification based on ESC guidelines showed a strong correlation with adverse outcomes. The model demonstrated strong predictive capability, with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8537. These results emphasize the importance of comprehensive risk assessment in managing PE patients and highlight the need for continuous monitoring and aggressive intervention in high-risk cases.

## Abstract


## Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition caused by the obstruction of pulmonary arteries, and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with risk stratification playing a crucial role in clinical decision-making. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines provide a structured approach to the diagnosis and management of PE, emphasizing the importance of early risk assessment to guide treatment strategies.
Risk stratification of patients with acute PE is mandatory for determining the appropriate therapeutic management approach. Initial risk stratification is based on clinical symptoms and signs of hemodynamic instability, which indicate a high risk of early death. In the large remaining group of patients, further risk stratification is required, and parameters such as Cardiac troponin I or T elevation in concentrations above the normal limits on admission may be associated with a worse prognosis in the acute phase of PE. 1
Baseline parameters related to aggravating conditions and comorbidity are necessary to assess a patientâ€™s overall mortality risk and early outcome. Of the clinical scores integrating PE severity and comorbidity, the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) is the one that has been most extensively validated to date. 
Regardless of the score used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE can be expected to be ~ 10% in the low-probability category, 30% in the moderate-probability category, and 65% in the high probability category. 2

## Methodology

Mimic III database was used to obtain data for the cohort.
All the admissions where the primary diagnosis (SEQ_NUM =1) was Pulmonary Embolism (ICD9 starting in 4151), were selected, and since there we more than one admission for different patients, the latest admission was selected those, obtaining 368 patients.
