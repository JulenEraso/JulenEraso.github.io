## Data Science

Data science is the field of study that uses mathematics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights from data. Data scientists would apply machine learning algorithms to data such as numbers, texts, images, videos, and more to produce artificial systems that perform tasks that require human intelligence. Using these systems, we extract insights from the data and use them to make better decisions in various situations.
